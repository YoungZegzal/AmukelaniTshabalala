                    <h3>Design & Development</h3>
                    <p>I began my coding journey when I was 14 years. The first ever coding language I learned was html. Being honest, I have never really been a fan of computers (probably because I never wanted to be a computer nerd). It's not until I got my first laptop in 2018, did I fall in love with them. When I switched on the screen, I was introduced to this whole new world and all I wanted to do was to learn more about it. So, I set out to learn more and more. I learned my first programming language (html) when I was in the 9th grade. My computer applications technology teacher taught us the basics, I obviously went on to learn a little bit more. Long story short I now know about 4 programming language (or maybe 3, does CSS count as a programming language?). Anyways, programming is one of my favorite hobbies and I think in due time I became really good at it.</p>

                    <h3>Writing</h3>
                    <p>One of my best qualities is my writing capabilities. I've always loved writing. I'm an extroverted introvert and quite obviously I love expressing myself, but because of the introvert section of my personality I've never been able to. That is until I started writing. I'm one person who's spent a lot of time reading so naturally I became very good at it. When I was in the 9th grade I entered a national writing competition (known as the SACEE writing competition) in which I won the silver award. Because I am so funny, most of the writing I do is comedy but I'm also exploring other genres, most notably tragedy. </p>

                    <h3>Acting</h3>
                    <p>Okay, this is just me saying I'm overly dramatic & change personalities a lot. LOL! But no, I am really good at acting. I love the idea of utilizing different personalities at any given point in time. Honestly, I hate routines even in terms of the type of person I am. I love experimenting with different personalities and this has been really helpful when meeting different people with different personalities. But yeah, acting is something I really want to try out in the near future.

                    <h3>Chess</h3>
                    <p> One of my favorite hobbies is playing chess & I have to admit I'm really good at it. I started playing chess when I was in the seventh grade. I decided to try it out because most of my friends were playing it and they seemed to really enjoy themselves. At first I was a little skeptical because, well, I did not want to be a nerd. But they managed to sway me and here I was. The first day was a little rough because I was the worst player in existence, even 8 year old kids were beating me in just 3 moves but as time went on my interest grew more and more and in turn I became better and better. But there aren't many young people, or people in general, who play chess. This meant that I was very limited with how many face to face games I would play with people and in turn I just decided to take a break. But recently I've decided to start playing again and wow am I out of practice. But hopefully I can regain my composure and become the greatest chess player of all time. </p>

                    <h3>Programming</h3>
                    <p> As I stated at the "My Skills" section, I love programming. But programming is not just a special skill but also my favorite hobby. I've love programming ever since I learned how to do it and devoted a lot of my time trying to better myself. Even this website was made during my free time. I will continue bettering myself until I'm the best out there. </p>

                    <h3>Writing</h3>
                    <p> Yep, that's right, I love writing. As an introvert I am very limited in how much I am willing to say but I can easily express my feeling through writing and I must say I have become very good at it. Over time I have learned many writing techniques that allow me to sort of manipulate how the reader.
